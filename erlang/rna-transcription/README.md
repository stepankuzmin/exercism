# Rna Transcription

Write a program that, given a DNA strand, returns its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

* * * *

For running the tests provided, only libraries delivered with recent
versions of erlang are used, so there is no need to install anything.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following commands from
the exercise directory. Please substitute `$EXERCISE` with the
exercises name.

```sh
erl -make
erl -noshell -eval "eunit:test($EXERCISE, [verbose])" -s init stop
```
